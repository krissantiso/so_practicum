Reference shell errors:
close a - infinite loop
delrec ../.. - makes everything not work until u go back enough with cd ../..

Solved weirdly:
date doesnt work xd - added 1 to all month calls so it works (ask if it starts at 0)

WHAT'S LEFT:
comment erase and delrec with auxiliary

DOUBTS:
ask teacher if in listfile, erase and delrec we print an error for no name provided or print cwd
