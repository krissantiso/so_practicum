close a - infinite loop

When printing the open files it says O_APPEND to the standard input
date doesnt work xd - added 1 to all month calls so it works (ask if it starts at 0)

change help for listfile
listdir only works until u use -link, then it never works again

reclist and revlist only print one directory contents like listdir and not subdirectories
